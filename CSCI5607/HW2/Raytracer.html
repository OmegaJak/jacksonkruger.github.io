		<h2>Homework 2 - Basic Raytracer</h2>
		<p><i>Jackson Kruger</i></p>
    <p>
      Normally, the source code would be on <a href="https://github.umn.edu/kruge203/CSCI5607/tree/master/Raytracer">Github</a>,
        but because of some issues that popped up last-minute, <a href="Raytracer_src.zip" download>here's</a> a zip of the code used for the images seen here currently. <br>
      For this assignment, unlike my previous two, I did this development on Windows in Visual Studio.
    </p>
    <h4>Currently functional features (which should be apparent form the outputs below)</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Camera placement, film resolution, aspect ratio</li>
        <li>User specified background colors</li>
        <li>BMP output</li>
        <li>Spheres</li>
        <li>Ambient lights, point lights, shadows, multiple lights</li>
        <li>Basic sampling</li>
        <li>Diffuse, specular, ambient, and (recursive) reflective lighting</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Architecture Overview</h4>
    <p>
      The file containing main, Raytracer.cpp, only exists to kick things off. It tells <b>Parser</b> what file to parse, who then initializes the relevant
			objects and sets appropriate values. The most important objects it initializes are the <b>Renderer</b>, the <b>Scene</b>, and the <b>Camera</b>.
			The <b>Scene</b> contains all of the lights and shapes (<b>SceneObject</b>s), while the camera primarily exists to construct the rays.
			The <b>Renderer</b> is the bridge between the <b>Camera</b> and the <b>Scene</b>, as well as the final <b>Image</b>
      object that is used to output at the end. It iterates over width and height, telling the camera to construct the rays, getting the colors
      of the pixels from the <b>Scene</b>, then setting the pixels of the <b>Image</b>. The <b>Scene</b> iterates through its list of pointers to <b>SceneObjects</b>, telling
			each sceneobject to intersect with the current <b>Ray</b>, producing an <b>Intersection</b>. <b>Intersection</b>s currently are just a struct of <b>Vector3</b>s and a <b>Material</b>,
			but will soon be objects in their own right with a pointer to the <b>Ray</b> and <b>SceneObject</b> who produced it, as well as a <b>Vector3</b> for the normal.
    </p>
		<h4>Challenges So Far</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The direction for the camera defined in the scene file confused me, particularly when it was posted that this direction is actually from the
			viewing plane to the camera. My raycasting was working imagining the direction as being from the camera to the plane, but it was horizontally flipped.
			I tried for quite a while to find a mistake in my ray generation code to accomodate literally flipping the direction vector on parsing, but that simply
			turned the camera around. In the end I just fixed the horizontal flippage with a little hack, multiplying by -1 in the right place.</li>
			<li>Refraction has been architecturally painful so far, as I've prepared to implement it.</li>
			<li>The exact meaning of max_depth wasn't clear initially, whether it meant that many reflections (rays + 1) or that many rays total. I wasted some time debugging
			my recursive reflections before realizing that I was interpreting max_depth as the max number of rays to generate total, not the max number of bounces.</li>
		</ul>
		Besides these pains, I focused pretty heavily on the architecture at the beginning and I think it really paid off. Features that seemed like they'd be difficult
		to implement often ended up being very quick.
    <h3>Output Images</h3>
    <h4>Sample scenes</h4>
    <p>
      The following are the rendered outputs of the provided sample scenes. The only modifications I made to these before running them
        were commenting out the output_image line as I haven't yet bothered to parse desired output_image location. I currently just output
        in the working directory to a file called "raytraced.bmp".

    <h4>Custom scenes</h4>
    <p>
      Each of these is just a sample scene with another point_light added.

	<h4>Resolution and Aspect Ratio</h4>
	<p> These are just to show that my Raytracer can handle odd FOV's and resolutions (they have hover text)</p>
