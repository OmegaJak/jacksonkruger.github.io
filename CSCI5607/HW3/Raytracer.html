		<h2>Homework 3 - Fully-Featured Raytracer</h2>
		<p><i>Jackson Kruger</i></p>
    <p>
      The source code for my Raytracer can be found on <a href="https://github.umn.edu/kruge203/CSCI5607/tree/master/Raytracer">Github</a>.
      I developed this Raytracer in Visual Studio in Windows. A compiled executable can be downloaded <a href="#" download>here</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Features (which should be apparent from the outputs below)</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arbitrary camera placement, film resolution, aspect ratio</li>
        <li>User specified background color</li>
        <li>BMP output</li>
        <li>Spheres, Triangles (both with auto normals and user-specified surface normals), Planes, Rectangles, Rectangular Prisms</li>
        <li>Ambient lights, point lights, spot lights, directional lights, multiple lights</li>
        <li>Basic sampling, grid-based supersampling, jittered supersampling</li>
        <li>Diffuse, specular, ambient, (bounded) recursive reflective and refractive lighting, hard shadows</li>
				<li>Depth of field</li>
				<li>Motion warp - makes images look like they're going really fast but doesn't blur them (more of a rolling shutter kind of thing)</li>
      </ul>
			Attempted but not working or barely working:
			<ul>
				<li>BVH as an acceleration structure - more on this below</li>
				<li>Motion blur - more below</li>
			</ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Architecture Overview</h4>
    <p>
      The file containing main, Raytracer.cpp, only exists to kick things off. It tells <b>Parser</b> what file to parse, who then initializes the relevant
			objects and sets appropriate values. The most important objects it initializes are the <b>Renderer</b>, the <b>Scene</b>, and the <b>Camera</b>.
			The <b>Scene</b> contains all of the lights and shapes, while the camera primarily exists to construct the rays.
			The <b>Renderer</b> is the bridge between the <b>Camera</b> and the <b>Scene</b>, as well as the final <b>Image</b>
      object that is used to output at the end. It iterates over width and height, telling the camera to construct the rays, getting the colors
      of the pixels from the <b>Scene</b>, then setting the pixels of the <b>Image</b>. The <b>Scene</b> has a collection of <b>Intersectable</b>s which it
			it tells to intersect with the current <b>Ray</b>, potentiall modifying the out-parameter <b>Intersection</b>. I employed object-oriented patterns pretty heavily,
			and leveraged C++'s polymorphism heavily as well. For example, a <b>Primitive</b> is something that is both <b>Intersectable</b> and <b>Materialed</b>.
			An <b>IntersectableGroup</b> is a collection of other <b>Intersectable</b>s, and is thus itself <b>Intersectable</b>, but does not have a <b>Material</b>.
    </p>
		<h4>Notes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> I spent a while trying to figure out why my point lights weren't getting as bright as the sample images when very close to objects.
				It was simply because early on I'd decided to clamp my PointLight's illuminance when returned.</li>
			<li> I really tried to get a BVH working. I set up all the necessary logic to use axis-aligned bounding boxes, put them around all primitives,
				intelligently grew the bounding boxes to encompass all children in an IntersectableGroup, etc. But in the end my BVH actually slowed down my Raytracer.
				I think the most likely cause of this was how I constructed the BVH. I used a top-down approach. An IntersectableGroup would split its BoundingBox
				in half (halving the longest dimension), and make two new IntersectableGroups to match these BB's. It would then iterate through its children, checking
				if their bounding boxes intersected or were contained in the half bounding boxes, and adding them to the relevant IntersectableGroups if they did.
				It would then clear its children, add the two new IntersectableGroups as children, and tell them to initialize their BVH's, recursing. Each IntersectableGroup
				would then regenerate its bounding box to fit its children, which happened in a bottom-up fashion. I also tried splitting into 8 bounding boxes. I tried varying the
				desired number of children per node (2-8) but this didn't seem to make a difference.
				<br><br>
				Largely regardless of tweaks I made to this approach, most of my scenes were at least twice as slow when using the BVH's. I couldn't figure out why. Additionally,
				any tri-heavy scenes I tried crashed due to a stack overflow (something was happening to produce 0-size bounding boxes, leading to infinite recursion). So I cut
				my losses and put my BVH work onto a <a href="https://github.umn.edu/kruge203/CSCI5607/tree/FailedBVHAttempt/Raytracer/Raytracer">branch on GitHub</a>, reverting the 
				work from my main branch. Most of the relevant code can be found in BoundingBox.cpp and IntersectableGroup::InitializeBVH().
			</li>
			<li>I attempted motion blur but wasn't happy with my results. First I tried moving objects over time, with time passing as pixels are drawn. This produced
				something of a 'motion warp' distortion, which I kept, but was not motion blur. I then tried a couple variations on the method of setting the time to a random value
				for each ray as it's cast from the camera, then averaging the results, but I wan't happy with this. I'm not sure how to get good-looking motion blur. I left that 
				implementation in my main rendering loop (in Renderer.cpp), but commented it out.
			</li>
			<li>At some point I decided to put the logic for determining which intersection is closer into Intersection itself. After many bugs arising because of the approach I'm now
				pretty sure this was a poor way to do it.
			</li>
			<li>My images are horizontally flipped from the images provided by Mr. Guy. This is because I envisioned the camera viewing plane as being projected directly
				onto the monitor, while he imagined them as being viewed from the other side.

    <h4>Sample scenes</h4>

      The following are the rendered outputs of the provided sample scenes. The only modification I made to these before running them
        was changing the output file location.

	<h4>Resolution and Aspect Ratio</h4>
	<p>
		These are just to show that my Raytracer can handle odd FOV's and resolutions (they have hover text). Note that these images
		were rendered at the for the first checkin (HW2), and thus don't have refraction in them.

	<h4>Performance</h4>
	<p>I'm not too happy with my performance overall, especially considering my failure to implement a BVH. I also didn't attempt parallelization as my Raytracer
		doesn't seem to be CPU-bound. It's rare for a core to max while I'm running intense scenes, probably indicating it's spending much of its time creating/destroying objects.
		I didn't get a chance to give a thorough effort to optimize, beyond the little attempts I made throughout the project.
