	<h1>Final Project - Physical Sound Synthesis and Propagation Simulation</h1>
	<p><i>Jackson Kruger and Xinghua Hao</i></p>

	<p>
		The source code for this simulation can be found <a href="https://github.com/OmegaJak/UMN_CSCI5611_FinalProject">on Github</a>.
		A zip of the compiled executables and supporting files for the simulation
		can be downloaded <a href="SoundSimulation.zip" download>here</a>. We wrote this simulation with C++ OpenGL, based off of 
		my <a href="../HW2/PhysicalSimulation.html"> cloth simulation</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<img width=20% src="SoundSimulation.png">
	<p>
		The goal of this project was to combine a physically-based sound synthesis simulation with a physically-based sound propagation simulation. The sound is
		derived from the velocities at various points on the different strings, which are being executed using a compute shader. The simulation then shoots out
		rays in all directions to determine what paths the sound would take to reach the listener's ears. The generated audio is then adjusted accordingly
		(delayed, made quieter) and is played through SDL.

	<h2>Images and Videos</h2>
	<p>
		Main demo video
		<br>
		<em>Note: The audio may be very quiet when played through low-quality speakers like laptop speakers... The volume of the first few notes played should
			be on par with the typical volume of other things played through the same speakers at the same volume. Headphones are recommended. Sounds later in the video
			when the listener moves away from the audio source will be quiet. Unfortunately, a popping sound in the audio is normal.
		</em>

		are shown in the title bar of the simulation's window.

	<h2>Tools/Libraries Used</h2>
	<p>
		This cloth simulation is based on C++ OpenGL with a GLSL compute shader. We wrote it for Windows in Visual Studio. <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>
		is used to interface with Windows (displaying the window, outputting audio). 
		The library <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/">SDL_Image</a> is used to load textures.
		<a href="https://glad.dav1d.de/">Glad</a> is used as an interface to OpenGL.
		<a href="https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html">GLM</a> is used for math-related things.
